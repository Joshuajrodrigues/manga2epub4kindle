## A very light and simple terminal app in the making to convert all cbr manga to epub suitable for kindle devices.

Current Features
1) Trims Borders
2) Scales Images
3) Adds Metadata

Current Pitfalls
1) NO ERROR CHECKING FOR FILES LOL
2) NEEDS TESTING ON OTHER KINDLE DEVICES
3) NEEDS TO ADD SUPPORT FOR OTHER DEVICES
4) COULD USE A NICE FILE MANAGER
5) NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ITS SPEED AND COMPRESSION RATE
6) UPDATE THE PIT FALL SECTION TO LOWER CASE ONCE I FIX MY KEYBORD
