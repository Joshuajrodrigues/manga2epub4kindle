## A very light and simple terminal app in the making to convert all cbr manga to epub suitable for kindle devices.

## How to use:

1. Open you folder full of cbz/cbr files.
2. Open your terminal in your folder
3. Type in npx manga2epub4kindle
4. Follow insructions (Press enter to confirm on every step.)
5. Profit.

Metadata is stored in a JSON format in the same directory, this is done so that when a new volume/issue is released you dont have to type in the full data again. You can also convert in batches by selecting which files you want converted first.

## Example
